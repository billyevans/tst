# tst
Ternary search tree collection in rust with similar API to std::collections as it possible.
Now it's first simplest implementation, that's the reason why it's reccursive.

TODO:
- iter, iter_mut
- keys iterator
- values iterator
- [] mut access
- add prefixMatch
- add collect as iterator()
- add benchmark
- upload to cargo
- make non-reccursive
